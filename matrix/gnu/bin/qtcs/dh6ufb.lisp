;; The provided code snippet defines a macro named *barn-static-down* 
;; using the defmacro macro. The macro takes a let form as its body, 
;; which binds the value of eval to the result of calling the arguments 
;; function with nil as the argument.

;; Inside the let form, a lambda function is defined, which takes a locally 
;; form as its body. Inside the locally form, the sb-impl::original-exp 
;; function is called with the result of calling the arguments function 
;; with nil as the argument.

;; The macro is followed by the symbol 'magit-blame, which is not part
